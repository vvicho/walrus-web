Where can I purchase a Walrus?
An actual real-life Walrus, I don't know and I don't think you should. If you are talking about a Whacky Walrus NFT; you can mint them in our website at launch or purchase them in our OpenSea collection page afterwards.
You can get discounted Walruses when minting them in bundles! 1 Walrus - 0.03ETH + Gas, Walrus Double Pack (2 Walruses) - 0.05ETH + Gas, Walrus Hat-Trick! (3 Walruses) - 0.06ETH + Gas.

How rare is my Walrus?
Once all Walruses have been revealed, you can visit Rarity Tool to see the rarities of all Walruses based on their accessories/traits.

Are there Royalties?
Yes. 2.5% goes to OpenSea and another 2.5% to the artist.

Where can I find offical communication?
We will mainly use our Twitter account @WhackyWalrusNFT as the main source of communication. While Discord has some pros, we've decided that we won't be using it as there has been a lot of toxicity, spam, scam, and other negative experiences in other NFT projects that we want to avoid in ours. We will continue updating our site with more ways of communication if needed.
